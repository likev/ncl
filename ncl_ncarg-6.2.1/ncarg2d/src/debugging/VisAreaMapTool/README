VisAreaMap is a java-based tool to interactively display and query an
"AreaMap" data structure produced from the ncarg package "Areas". It
is intended only as a programmer's tool for debugging problems with
Areas that lead to the so-called ARSCAM/ARPRAM class of
errors. Typically VisAreaMap would be used in conjunction with a
debugger (i.e., gdb) to visualize events leading up to the error.  See
Jira ticket #32 for a document describing strategies for debugging
Areas problems.

Use of this program presumes the Java SDK is installed and in the path
on the target machine. To build VisAreaMap.jar simply type:

   make

To run the program:

   java -jar VisAreaMap.jar <...input area map file...>


The area-map input file is obtained by annotating modules in the Areas
package with a strategically placed bit of code to dump the area-map:

      open(unit=11, file="AreaMapPrePhase6") 
      do 99999 i=1,iam(1) 
          write(11,'(i8,1x,i8)') i, iam(i) 
99999 continue 
      close(11)

Where precisely this should be placed depends upon where the error
originates. To date, errors have arisen in either phases 5 or 6 of
both the source modules arscam.f and arpram.f. Once the location of
the error is determined, it is useful to insert the code to dump the
area-map at the beginning of the associated phase.
