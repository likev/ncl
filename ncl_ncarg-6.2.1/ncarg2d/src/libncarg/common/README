This directory contains functions fx(x,y) and fy(x,y) which are
used for coordinate transformations for most of the utility programs.
They used to be Fortran arithmetic statement functions and you just
grabbed the entire source code and hacked at them if you needed new
ones.  Now you link in your own fx() and fy() before editing the 
libncarg library.  (don middleton 88).
