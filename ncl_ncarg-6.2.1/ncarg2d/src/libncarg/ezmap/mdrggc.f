      SUBROUTINE MDRGGC (JCOL,JCSF)
C
C This routine may be called to get the values of two arrays in EZMAP,
C one of which determines the colors to be used for outline maps drawn
C using the RANGS/GSHHS data, and the other of which determines the
C colors to be used for solid-filled maps drawn using that data.
C
        INTEGER JCOL(5),JCSF(5)
C
C Declare required common blocks.  See MAPBDX for descriptions of these
C common blocks and the variables in them.
