      SUBROUTINE PWRZGI (KCHAR,JCHAR,INDEX,NSIZE,IPOINT)
C
C THIS ROUTINE FINDS WHERE KCHAR IS IN JCHAR AND RETURNS THE CORRES-
C PONDING INDEX IN IPOINT.  BINARY HALVING IS USED.
C
      SAVE
      CHARACTER*1     JCHAR(NSIZE)     ,KCHAR
      DIMENSION       INDEX(NSIZE)
C
C IT IS ASSUMED THAT JCHAR IS LESS THAT 2**9 IN LENGTH, SO IF KCHAR IS
C NOT FOUND IN 10 STEPS, THE SEARCH IS STOPPED.
