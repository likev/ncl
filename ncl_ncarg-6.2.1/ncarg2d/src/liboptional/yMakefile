#	Makefile for nonstandard dash, conran, and conrec routines.
#
#	This family of routines	share entry point names, 
#	thus causing symbol clashes when sharing a library.  
#	These routines are saved in relocatable
#	object files, and may be loaded before the standard libraries
#	are searched.
#
#	The default routines exist in libncarg.a and are currently
#	dashsmth, conran, and conrec.
#	The remaining members of these families are managed from
#	within the libmisc subtree of the distribution.
