C     LET NXSIZE BE DEFINED JUST AS IN SUBROUTINE REMOVE, NAMELY
C     SUCH THAT  2**NXSIZE = NUMBER OF MODEL PICTURE POINTS IN X- AND
C     Y- DIRECTION. (NXSIZE IS THE RESOLUTION OF THE MODEL PICTURE. THE
C     MODEL PICTURE IS ASSUMED TO BE QUADRATIC.)
C     THEN ISKIP IS DEFINED AS
C         ISKIP = 2**(15-NXSIZE)
C
C     ISKIP IS USED TO SPEED UP THE MARKING OF POINTS IN THE MODEL
C     PICTURE. THE FACT IS USED THAT 1 POINT IN THE MODEL PICTURE
C     REPRESENTS ISKIP*ISKIP METACODE ADDRESS UNITS.
