This directory, dashsupr, has implementation dependent constants in
dashbd.f and remove.f.  There are various versions of remove.f, all of which
have the variables NXSIZE and NYSIZE set to 10.  dashbd.f has ISKIP
set assuming these values.  If you change NXSIZE and NYSIZE in remove*.f,
you must also make proper changes in dashbd.f.
