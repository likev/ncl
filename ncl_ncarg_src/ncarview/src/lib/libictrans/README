ictrans has a functional interface defined in the file ictrans.c. For a
disk resident CGM ictrans may be invoked via the ICTrans() subroutine. A 
description of the parameters for this routine may be found in the file
ictrans.c. The third argument should be set to NULL for a disk resident
CGM. The process of invoking ictrans for a memory resident CGM is a bit more
complicated. The third argument to ICTrans is the *name* of a metafile 
resident in memory. Such a file can be created with the utilities in libcgm.
The file ictrans_mem.c contains an example of how memory files can be
created, written to, and closed.
