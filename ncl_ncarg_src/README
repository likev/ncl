This is the top level directory for version 6.4.0 of the NCL and NCAR
Graphics source code. 

This source can be used to build NCL or just NCAR Graphics.  Note:
NCL depends on NCAR Graphics, so you will get both if you elect to
build NCL.

The documentation for NCL can be found at:

    http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/

While NCAR Graphics is part of the NCL source code tree, it has
its own documentation:

    http://www.ncarg.ucar.edu/

Generally, we recommend that people install NCL and NCAR Graphics
using a precompiled binary. We provide precompiled binaries for
several flavors of LINUX, MacOS, and Windows/Cygwin. The NCL and NCAR
Graphics precompiled binaries are hosted on the Earth System Grid
website:

   http://www.earthsystemgrid.org
