! XyPlot Data resources
! This resource is only needed by the C version of the example.
!
*ctYTableType:  Float
!
! XyDataSpec resources for the C version of this example.  This has to be
! done because a CoordArrTable object was used in the C program, and thus
! the resources must be stored in one array.
