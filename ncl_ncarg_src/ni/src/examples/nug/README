These are the NCL, Python, and KSH scripts that Karin Meier-Fleischer
of DKRZ developed for the NCL User Guide (NUG).

They should be copied to the web via:

  scp *.ncl *.ksh *.py webpub.ucar.edu:/web/ncl/Document/Manuals/NCL_User_Guide/Scripts/.

  http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Manuals/NCL_User_Guide/Scripts/

The smaller data files are part of the NCL distribution in 

   $NCARG/ni/src/examples/data/nug

The larger data files were copied straight to the web:

  http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Manuals/NCL_User_Guide/Data/

  webpub.ucar.edu:/web/ncl/Document/Manuals/NCL_User_Guide/Data/
