If having problems with the HLUs on the Cray, the first thing I try is
compiling Convert.c with optimization turned off.

If having troubles compiling Create.c on Cygwin because of an sa_handler
error message, try compiling without -ansi.

I had trouble compiling Workstation.c on an x86_64 Linux system using
the Intel (icc) compiler. I got an internal error message. So, I
used gcc to compile just this one file.
