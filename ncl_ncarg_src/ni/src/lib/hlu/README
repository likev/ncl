If having problems with the HLUs on the Cray, the first thing I try is
compiling Convert.c with optimization turned off.

If having trouble compiling Create.c on Cygwin because of an sa_handler
error message, try compiling without -ansi.

If having trouble compiling Workstation.c on an x86_64 Linux system using
the Intel (icc) compiler and getting an "internal" error message, try
using gcc to compile just this one file.

If triangle.c and triangle.h are missing and you need these files,
get them from this website:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

There should be a link to a ".zip file" which you can unzip with:

unzip triangle.zip

DO NOT UNZIP THIS FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY, because it may
overwrite your "Makefile". Instead, download it somewhere
temporary, and then copy over "triangle.c" and "triangle.h"
to this directory.
