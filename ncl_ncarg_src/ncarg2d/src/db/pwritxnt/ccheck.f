      SUBROUTINE CCHECK (IERR)
C
C SHORT TEST ROUTINE FOR THE CORRECT ACCESSING OF THE COMPLEX CHARACTER
C SET.
C
C ON ENTRY
C   IERR MAY CONTAIN ANY VALUE.
C ON EXIT
C   IERR = 0 IF 2 SHORT TESTS OF THE DIGITIZATION RETRIEVAL PROCESS
C            WERE SUCCESSFUL
C        = 2 IF THE TEST WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR 6 BIT DIGITIZATION UNITS
C            BUT NOT SUCCESSFUL FOR 12 BIT DIGITIZATION UNITS
C        = 1 IF THE TEST WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR 12 BIT DIGITIZATION UNITS
C            BUT NOT SUCCESSFUL FOR 6 BIT DIGITIZATION UNITS.
C        = 3 IF NEITHER OF THE 2 TESTS WAS SUCCESSFUL.
