To get the latest versions of the I1MACH and R1MACH routines:
------------------------------------------------------------
Send email to netlib@ornl.gov with the following request in the
subject header or text body:

  send i1mach from slatec/src

You'll promptly (depending on Internet traffic) receive e-mail from
netlib, containing the I1MACH source code.  Of course, you can do this
for D1MACH as well.

You can also access Netlib via the World Wide Web. 
The URL is:

    http://www.netlib.org/index.html

If you have trouble accessing netlib files, please 
send email to netlib_maintainers@netlib.org.

           (-qstrict is okay).
